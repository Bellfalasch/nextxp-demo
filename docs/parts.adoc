Enonic provides a highly customizable component type called link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/components/components#part[parts]. Similar to page components parts must be defined in both Enonic and Next in order to fully work.

== Task: Add part to Enonic
We'll start off by adding a component that lists child items in the tree structure.

. **Add the `child-list` part** to the Enonic app
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/child-list/child-list.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<part xmlns="urn:enonic:xp:model:1.0">
    <display-name>Child list</display-name>
    <description>Lists children of current item</description>
    <form>
        <input name="sorting" type="ComboBox">
            <label>Sort order</label>
            <occurrences minimum="0" maximum="1"/>
            <config>
                <option value="displayName ASC">Ascending</option>
                <option value="displayName DESC">Descending</option>
            </config>
            <default>displayName ASC</default>
        </input>
    </form>
</part>
----
+
NOTE: This part descriptor also contains a form, similar to content types, which enable editors to configure it - sorting Ascending or Descending.
+
To work seamlessly with Content Studio's WYSIWYG preview, parts need a special controller file that assists the preview to load changes to the component, without refreshing the entire page.
+
. **Add the preview controller file** for the child-list part
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/child-list/child-list.js
[source,JavaScript]
----
var proxy = require('/lib/nextjs-proxy/proxy');

exports.get = proxy.get;
----
+
. **Build and deploy your Enonic app** once more to make the new part accessible to from Content Studio.
+
. **Add parts to the page**
+
After re-deploying the app, head over to Content Studio, this time, lets edit the `Persons` page. Drag'n drop the new part into the region (`right-click -> Insert`, or drag-n-drop from the `Insert panel`` on the right).
+
TIP: As you can see, the part appear without making any changes to Next, this is because the Enonic adapter contains fallback part rendering, when Next is running in DEV mode.
+

+
TIP: As usual, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000/persons to verify it directly from Next.js.

== Task: Configure part rendering in Next

Moving over to the Next app, we must register the new component that support actual rendering of this part.

. **Add the part handlers to the Next app**
+
.src/components/parts/ChildList.tsx
[source,JavaScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}/components/parts/ChildList.tsx[]
----
+
. Then, **register the components** in _mappings.ts:
+
Update _mappings.ts with the following new lines:
+
.src/components/_mappings.ts
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
import ChildList, {childListProcessor, getChildList} from './parts/ChildList';

...

ComponentRegistry.addPart(`${APP_NAME}:child-list`, {
    query: getChildList,
    processor: childListProcessor,
    view: ChildList
});
----
+
As you might have noticed this component has query, view and processor. A processor is an optional JavaScript function that can do whatever you need it to. For instance fetch data from another source than the CMS, or post-process the query response before it is passed to the view.
+
The Enonic adapter will execute the query, pass the result via the processor, the to the view which finally renders the part.
+
TODO: Update this image
image:cs-part-nextjsviewed.png[title="Next.js-rendered text component with an image",width=700px]
+ 
Try customizing the part configuration and see what happens.

== Optional Task: The heading part

For more components to play with, you may add another part:

. **Add files** to the Enonic app
+
This part definition includes a form, with an link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/components/input-types[input field] called `heading`. This makes it possible for editors to override the heading (aka displayName) coming from the content item.
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/heading/heading.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<part xmlns="urn:enonic:xp:model:1.0">
    <display-name>Heading</display-name>
    <description>Demo heading</description>
    <form>
        <input type="TextLine" name="heading">
            <label>Override heading</label>
        </input>
    </form>
</part>
----
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/heading/heading.js
[source,JavaScript]
----
var proxy = require('/lib/nextjs-proxy/proxy');

exports.get = proxy.get;
----
+
. **Redeploy** the Enonic app and add the part to your page
+
. **Add and register** the heading component in Next
+
.src/components/parts/Heading.tsx
[source,JavaScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}/components/parts/Heading.tsx[]
----
Add the following lines to _mappings.ts:
+
.src/components/_mappings.ts
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
import Heading from './parts/Heading';

...

ComponentRegistry.addPart(`${APP_NAME}:heading`, {
    view: Heading
});
----
+
You should now have two configurable parts to play with.

In the next chapter we will make page composition even more interesting by <<layouts#, introducing layouts>>.
