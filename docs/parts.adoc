Enonic offers a type of highly customizable component - called link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/components/components#part[parts]. Similar to page components parts must be defined in both Enonic and Next in order to fullt work.

== Task: Add parts to Enonic
We'll start off by adding a component that lists child items in the tree structure.

. **Add the `child-list` part** to the Enonic app
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/child-list/child-list.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<part xmlns="urn:enonic:xp:model:1.0">
  <display-name>Children</display-name>
  <description>Lists child items</description>
</part>
----
+
To work seamlessly with Content Studio's WYSIWYG page editor, parts in Enonic need a special controller file that assists the preview to load changes to the component, without refreshing the entire page.
+
. **Add the preview controller file** for the child-list part
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/child-list/child-list.js
[source,JavaScript]
----
var proxy = require('/lib/nextjs-proxy/proxy');

exports.get = proxy.get;
----
+
Now, lets repeat this procedure for the heading part as well:
+
. **Add the `heading` part files** to the Enonic app
+
This part definition includes a form, with an link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/components/input-types[input field] called `heading`. This makes it possible for editors to override the heading (aka displayName) coming from the content item.
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/heading/heading.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<part xmlns="urn:enonic:xp:model:1.0">
    <display-name>Heading</display-name>
    <description>Demo heading</description>
    <form>
        <input type="TextLine" name="heading">
            <label>Override heading</label>
        </input>
    </form>
</part>
----
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/heading/heading.js
[source,JavaScript]
----
var proxy = require('/lib/nextjs-proxy/proxy');

exports.get = proxy.get;
----
+
. **Build and deploy your Enonic app** once more to make the new part accessible to from Content Studio.
+
. **Add parts to the page**
+
After re-deploying the app, head over to Content Studio, this time, lets edit the Persons page. Drag'n drop the new parts into the region (`right-click -> Insert`, or drag-n-drop from the `Insert panel`` on the right).
+
TIP: As you can see, the parts appear without making any changes to Next, this is because the CMS adapter contains fallback part rendering when Next is running in DEV mode.

+
TIP: As usual, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000/persons to verify it directly from Next.js.

== Task: Configure part rendering in Next

Moving over to the Next.js, we must add new components that support actual rendering of these parts.

. **Add the part handlers to the Next app**
+
.src/components/parts/Heading.tsx
[source,JavaScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}/components/parts/Heading.tsx[]
----
+
.src/components/parts/ChildList.tsx
[source,JavaScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}/components/parts/Heading.tsx[]
----
+
. Finally, **register the components** in _mappings.ts:
+
Update _mappings.ts with the following new lines:
+
.src/components/_mappings.ts
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
import ChildList, {childListProcessor, getChildList} from './parts/ChildList';
import Heading from './parts/Heading';

...

TypesRegistry.addPart(`${APP_NAME}:child-list`, {
    query: getChildList,
    processor: childListProcessor,
    view: ChildList
});
TypesRegistry.addPart(`${APP_NAME}:heading`, {
    view: Heading
});
----
Next.js will now use the new views and queries to render the parts. Try overriding the heading, and see what happens.

With parts completed, in the next chapter we will make page composition even more interesting by <<layouts#, introducing layouts>>.
