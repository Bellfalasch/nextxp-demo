== Introduction

In this tutorial we will demonstrate a powerful approach where the structure and content in the CMS determines the URLs and content available in the front-end. This is possible as Enonic (unlike many other Headless CMS') supports tree-structures. 

This setup basically provide editors with a CMS experience they are accustomed to, and developers get a front-end that is cleanly separated from the CMS. The headless architecture ensures the content can be accessed and used by other clients as well - ofcourse.

== Overview

You will complete the following steps:

* Setup an Enonic app using a template
* Run queries against the Headless API
* Create a Next.js app using a next template
* Setting up preview in Enonic
* Rendering content based on its type
* Building and creating WYSIWYG landing pages
* Deploying to production
