This guide assumes you are already somewhat familiar with link:https://nextjs.org/[Next.js]. Experience with Enonic is recommended, but not required.

== Introduction

In this tutorial we will demonstrate a close integration between Next.js and Enonic, where the structure and content in the CMS determines the URLs and pages available in the front-end.

The editors get an editing experience they are accustomed to, and developers get a front-end that is cleanly separated from the CMS. The headless architecture ensures the content can be accessed and used by other clients as well - naturally.

== Overview

You will complete the following steps:

* Setup Enonic SDK and content via template
* Run queries against the Headless API
* Create a Next.js app using a template 
* Setting up preview in Enonic
* Rendering content based on types
* Using components to build landing pages
* Setting up page templates
* Deploying to live servers

== TLDR;

The impatient may skip to the end of the tutorial, and get a live demo by following these instructions: If you want to learn what is really happening, head on to the <<enonic-setup#, first chapter>> instead.

=== 1. Setup Enonic

. Sign up to Enonic Cloud: https://enonic.com/sign-up/cloud-trial
. Create a new solution based on the `Next.js demo` template
. From `solution/environments` **open the "Drafts" route** in your browser
+
By adding `/_graphql` to the end of this URL, you should be able to browse the API. Take a note of this URL, as you will need it later.

=== 2. Create Git repo

Vercel, which we will be using to host the Next.js project requires access to a Git repo,  where your account has write access.

. Clone or fork https://github.com/enonic/nextjs-enonic-demo/ to a Github/Bitbucket/Gitlab account you have access to
+
NOTE: If you are using Github, simply press the `Fork` button at the top right.
+
. Note the URL to your new Git repository, you will need it in the next step (pun intended).

=== 3. Deploy Next app
For simplicity, you'll be using Vercel to host the Next.js app. Vercel are the makers of Next.js.

. Sign up to Vercel: https://vercel.com/ 
. Create a new project `enonic-demo-drafts` and connect it to the repo you created in step 2.
. **Add environment variables** referencing the URL to the drafts API - like this:
+
KEY:: CONTENT_API_URL
VALUE:: <absolute url to the content drafts API> 
+
. After deploying, the Next app should now render the front page:
+

+
TIP: Check the Vercel function logs if you are not getting the expected result.

=== 4. Enable preview
With a Next.js preview server running, we may link it to Content Studio.

. In Enonic, go to solution/applications/Nextjs demo and **edit the application configuration**.
+
`nextjsUrl=<absolute url to your next.js drafts server>`
+
. **Launch the Enonic XP admin**, and open Content Studio. You should now be able to see the preview in the right hand panel.
+

=== Go live

The final step is to launch a Vercel project that renders the published (aka live) content.

. **Create a new `nextjs-demo-live` project** in Vercel, using the same Github repo as before
. This time however, **Configure the project** to access the "Live" API instead of "Drafts".
+
Once the the server has started, it should render a 404 page. This is simply because your content has not yet been published.
+
. **Publish the content** from Content Studio by selecting the site, and then `Publish Tree` from the top right menu.
. After publishing, your site should be live and kicking
+
Congratulations, you now have a Next.js site powered by Enonic!
