== Introduction

In this tutorial we will demonstrate a powerful approach where the structure and content in the CMS determines the URLs and content available in the front-end. This is possible as Enonic (unlike many other Headless CMS') supports tree-structures. 

This setup basically provide editors with a CMS experience they are accustomed to, and developers get a front-end that is cleanly separated from the CMS. The headless architecture ensures the content can be accessed and used by other clients as well - ofcourse.
