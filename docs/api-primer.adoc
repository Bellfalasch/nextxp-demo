= Getting to know the API

Based on the developer environment you setup in the previous chapter, you'll now learn about Enonic's headless graphql API, aka Guillotine

== Headless API

Enonic provides and out-of-the-box GraphQL API that dynamically to reflects your site's content types and data model. The API is very flexible, and the developer controls the version of the API being used, and may even customize it. For more details on the foundations of the API, visit the link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/guillotine/stable[Guillotine documentation].

== Task: Run a simple query

. **Access the guillotine API:**
+
Visit this link http://localhost:8080/site/hmdb/draft/hmdb/_graphql to access the Headless API, and the draft content items.
+

+
The interface served when we access the endpoint lets us browse the API directly. Use the tabs on the far right to discover. Use the left hand field to type/paste in queries, press the "play" button in the middle to **run the query**, and the result will be presented in the right hand field.
+
. **Query movies**:
+
One of the objectives in this tutorial is listing and presenting movie details. Run this simple query that retrieves the ID and displayName of some movies:
+
.Query to fetch movies from the Headless API:
[source,GraphQL]
----
{
    guillotine {
        query(query: "valid='true' and type='com.example.myproject:movie'", sort: "displayName") {
            id: _id
            displayName
        }
    }
}
----
+
. **View the Result**
+
After executing the query, you should get a result in the right panel.

== Task: Query variables

In addition to the query itself, GraphQL also supports optional `variables`.
Variables enable you to re-use the same query, but for instance fetch different content each time.

. **Add query** to the GraphQL playground:
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
query($path:ID!){               <!--1-->
  guillotine {
    get(key:$path) {            <!--2-->
      type
      _id
      displayName
    }
  }
}
----
<1> `path` is declared (with a `$` marking it as a variable in the query). The declaration includes its type (`ID`), and a `!` marking it as a _required_ parameter).
<2> The `path` variable here used as the value of the `key` parameter, passed to the `get` field.
+
. **Add query Variables** using the tab at the bottom to add a `variables` JSON object. Notice how the `path` field corresponds to the `$path` in the query string.:
+
[source,JSON]
----
{
    "path": "${site}/movies/se7en"
}
----
+
NOTE: ${site} is a valid path element in Guillotine paths, and will internally resolve the path of the site and expand it - in this case the full path will be expanded to `/hmdb/movies/se7en`.
+
. **Run the query** with the variables, and see the result.

== Task: Type introspection

The queries above only specify fields like `_id` and `displayName` for each content found. These are general fields in the CMS, available across all content types.

Content types may also define their own link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/content-types[custom fields]. These are stored under the `data` field. In the headless API, deeper data and functionality belonging to a content type is accessed through **introspection**.

For example, you may introspect the fields that are exclusive to the `com.example.myproject:movie` content type like this:

.Content type introspection:
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
... on com_example_myproject_Movie
----
NOTE: The fully-qualified content type name is used, dots are replaced with underscores, and the name is capitalized `Movie`.

. **Fetch a complex data set**
+
Lets get content for a movie, the referenced _image_ items `media:image` and _person_ items `com.example.myproject:person` in a single query:
+
Copy this query into the GraphQL playground...
+
.A query with nested introspections
[source,JavaScript]
----
query($path:ID!){
  guillotine {
    get(key:$path) {
      type
      displayName
      ... on com_example_myproject_Movie {
        data {
          subtitle
          abstract
          trailer
          release
          photos {
            ... on media_Image {
                imageUrl: imageUrl(type: absolute, scale: "width(500)")
            }
          }
          cast {
            character
            actor {
              displayName
              ... on com_example_myproject_Person {
                _path
                data {
                  photos {
                    ... on media_Image {
                      imageUrl: imageUrl(type: absolute, scale: "block(100,100)")
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----
<1> See how `imageUrl` is requested with parameters of its own? Type introspections can expose certain link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/guillotine/stable/api[functions for processing data] before returning it.
+
Since the query is still parameterized with `$path`, we can use the same `variables` object used earlier
+
.Variables
[source,JSON]
----
{
    "path": "${site}/movies/pulp-fiction"
}
----
+
Run the query in the playground. It should produce a fully resolved set of data - which will come in handy later in this tutorial.
+
All in all, this allows for fetching deep and rich content data in a single API request.
