== Task: Configure the connection to XP

So the values in the `.env*` files must reflect the actual location of your Enonic server. _.env_ has common values, while _.env.development_ and _.env.production_ are runmode-specific. The most important difference is that they can point to different sites and branches (drafts or published items) of your Enonic server.

. **Verify configuration files** - the default values should match the settings we need in this tutorial:

..env* config values (example for dev mode):
[source,properties,options="nowrap"]
----
# Common value in .env:
APP_NAME=com.example.myproject                                      <!--1-->

# Runtime-specific values, here dev mode (.env.development):
SITE=hmdb                                                           <!--3-->
CONTENT_API_URL=$API_DOMAIN/site/hmdb/draft/$SITE/api               <!--4-->
NEXT_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3000

<1> `APP_NAME` should match your enonic app name e.g. `com.example.myproject`.
<3> `SITE` refers to the relative location of your site within Enonic, as you can see directly in Content Studio.

<4> `CONTENT_API_URL` is the _full URL_ to where both this Next.js-instance and the react components in the browser will contact the guillotine API for data. This should in the end be the same URL that you used when testing <<enonic-setup#setup-guillotine-api, GraphQL playground>> earlier.

[NOTE]
====
**`CONTENT_API_URL` is link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/deployment/vhosts[vhost]-sensitive**.

For example, let's say you've locally vhosted `hmdb-draft` to point to `/site/hmdb/draft/hmdb`, and changed the API mapping in site.xml from `/api` to `/_guillotine` (actually, vhosting is one area where that gets important). Then you could just set `API_DOMAIN=http://hmdb-draft:8080` and `CONTENT_API_URL=$API_DOMAIN/_guillotine`.

You still need to set and export `SITE` though, it's used elsewhere.
