= Custom pages
:toc: right
:imagesdir: media/
:sourcedir: ../src

So far, rendering has been based on hardcoded mappings made by the developer. In this chaper we will enable editors to compose their own pages.

== Task: Disable debug view
For every page you select, the debug view keeps appearing - even in Content Studio. You may disable this, simply by commenting out the `CATCH_ALL` content type view at the bottom of your mappings file - like this: 
+
.src/components/_mappings.ts
[source,TypeScript]
----
...

/*
// Debug
ComponentRegistry.addContentType(CATCH_ALL, {
    view: PropsView
});
*/
----


== Task: Setup page rendering

Content types need to exist in Enonic before an editor can create content. Similarly, page components must be defined before Content Studio can enable editors to create pages.

. *Add a page descriptor* to the Enonic app 
+
.src/main/resources/site/pages/main/main.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<page xmlns="urn:enonic:xp:model:1.0">
  <display-name>Main page</display-name>
  <description>Will be rendered by front-end</description>
  <form/>
  <regions>
      <region name="main"/>
  </regions>
</page>
----
+
NOTE: The definition of the region `main`, enable Content Studio editors to add components to the page, as you will see later.
+
Redploy the Enonic app to register the page component.
+
. **Configure page rendering in Next**
On the Next side of things, rendering a page is similar to rendering a content type. Add the following file to your Next project.
+
.src/components/pages/Main.tsx
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}/components/pages/Main.tsx[]
----
+
NOTE: Notice the <RegionsView> element, referring to the 'main' region
+
Finally, register it in the component mappings by adding the following lines to _mappings.ts
+
.src/components/_mappings.ts
[source,TypeScript]
----
import MainPage from './pages/Main';

...

ComponentRegistry.addPage(`${APP_NAME}:main`, {
    view: MainPage
});
----

Both Enonic and Next are now able to handle custom pages.

== Task: Create your first page

Its time to build a custom page.

. **Turn the site into a page**
+
From Content Studio, select and edit the site `/hmdb` content item. From the edit view, activate the page editor by clicking the monitor icon in the top right corner.
+
You should now see the following:
+
image:page-setup.png[title="Selecting the page component in the page view",width=1440px]
+
From the preview area, select the `Main` component we created earlier from the dropdown menu.
+
You should then see a page with a single "dropzone" inside (the region we specified earlier).
+
image:page-rendered.png[title="Active page controller rendering an empty region visualized by a placeholder",width=1440px]

== Task: Using the text component

Content Studio's ships with a built-in Text component which is handy when composing pages.

. From the Insert tab (on the right hand side), drag a Text component into the region. 
. Text mode will now be activated, and you can use the link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/content-studio/stable/editor/component-types#text_component[rich-text editor] to write and format text, but also insert images.
+
image:text-component.png[title="Next.js-rendered text component with an image",width=1440px]
+
. After saving, visit the Next.js rendering directly on http://localhost:3000/movies to see the result.
+
. You may also click the `Preview` button in Content Studio for a full screen version, rendered via the proxy.

That completes the introduction to page rendering, coming up we'll add <<parts#, dynamic page components>> to play with.
