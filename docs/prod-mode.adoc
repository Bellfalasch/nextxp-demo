= Deploying to production

In this chapter is optional, but gives you insight into running Next in production mode, and how to configure XP to access the preview server on a different URL.

== Dev vs Prod
So far, you have been running Next in dev mode. 
Before proceeding to live servers - you should try running the app in production mode locally. 
When running in production mode Next optimizes the build and performance of the app.

== Task: Production mode

TIP: The Next app has three config files `.env` holds common values, while `.env.development` and `.env.production` are runmode-specific.

. Verify that your production configuration references the draft API:
+
..env.production
[source,properties]
----
...

CONTENT_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/site/hmdb/draft/hmdb/_graphql
----
+
NOTE: When compared to the `.env.development` configuration, the main difference is referencing the `master` branch, vs the `draft` branch. The master branch holds your published content.
+
. Start Next in production mode:
+
    npm run prod
+
When pointing your browser to http://localhost:4242, you should see see the draft items, like in dev mode.
This time however - Next is running in optimized mode, which is what you will normally use for server deployments. **Sweet!**
+
As you may have noticed, this has caused preview to stop working, simply because Next is now running on a different port `:4242`.

== Task: Preview location

Let's have a look at how you can configure your app and SDK use a different location than the default `localhost:3000`.

When working in your local Enonic SDK, the sandboxes are stored in your home directory and the `.enonic/` folder. 

. **Create a configuration file** in your sandbox, with the following value:
+
..enonic/sandboxes/<mysandbox>/home/config/<app-name>.cfg
[source,properties]
----
nextjsUrl=http://localhost:4242
----
+
XP will automatically pickup the configuration and inject it in your app.
+
. **Refresh item in Content Studio**, and you should once again see the preview.

== Task: Rendering live content

So far, we have always been rendering draft items - with a simple switch, next can also render published items.

. Update your next configuration to reference the master branch API instead:
+
..env.production
[source,properties]
----
...

CONTENT_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/site/hmdb/master/hmdb/_graphql
----
+
NOTE: When compared to the `.env.development` configuration, the main difference is referencing the `master` branch, vs the `draft` branch. The master branch holds your published content.
+
. Restart Next, still using production mode:
+
    npm run prod
+
At this point, your site has not yet been published - and Next will not be able to access the API and it's content. 
+
When pointing your browser to http://localhost:4242, you should see the 404 error page.
+

+
. From Content Studio, **select your site and publish it** using the `Publish Tree` option from the top right action menu.
+
NOTE: **"Mark as ready"** In order to publish items, they all need to be marked as "Ready", you can quickly mark all relevant items as ready directly within the publishing wizard if needed.
+

+
After publishing, Next should now be rendering your site once again. This time however - it renders the published items.


With production mode, and live content tested - its time to start playing with <<deployment#, real servers>>!
