= Setting up Next.js
:toc: right

In this chapter we will create a front-end application that renders pages based on content in the CMS.

== Next.js at a glance

link:https://nextjs.org/[**Next.js**] runs on top of link:https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js], and provides a shrink-wrapped approach to building sites using the link:https://reactjs.org/[React framework]). Next.js supports both client-side rendering and link:https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended[Server side rendering], as well as pre-generation of static HTML files.


== Task: Create the Next.js project

Get the code by running the following command:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
npx degit git@github.com:enonic/nextjs-enonic-starter.git
----

The "nextjs-enonic-starter" is based on link:https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started[Next.js' own introduction app], so if you're familiar with that, you'll recognize the structure of the files.

The template includes some boilerplate we will customize, and some additional code that facilitates and simplifies integration with Enonic - aka **"the Enonic adapter"**.

=== Code overview

The following file structure should now exist within your new project folder:

.Next project files:
[source,files]
----
next.config.js                          <!--1-->
.env
.env.production
.env.development
src/
    cmsAdapter/                         <!--2-->
    components/                         <!--3-->
    pages/
        [[...contentPath]].tsx          <!--4-->
        _app.tsx                        <!--5-->
        _document.tsx
----

<1> These are the standard Next configuration files, we will use these to connect Next with Enonic.
<2> Contains the Enonic adapter - which is essentially a "black box", and you should not change any of these files. This will be released as an NPM in the future.
<3> Place your custom code here - integrates with Enonic via the adapter.
<4> The fallback next.js router, that enables dynamic rendering based on content in the CMS. `$$[$$$$[$$...contentPath$$]$$$$]$$.tsx` is the "magical" entry point. This is not a typo, but Next.js syntax that makes it catch all HTTP requests.
<5> `$$_$$app.tsx` and `$$_$$document.tsx` are vanilla Next.js modules that structure every rendering. You can add you own common structures here (eg. containers, layouts, styling, `<head>` etc), but be careful not to remove functionality needed by the XP's preview, as you will see later.

TIP: It's also possible to <<reference#download-to-existing-nextjs-project, add the Enonic adapter into an existing Next.js project>> instead of starting from scratch.


== Task: Configure application

Before we can boot the application, we need to let it know the location of the Content API.

TODO: 
Configure API + SITEPATH

== Task: Boot the server

Let's fire up Next and see if things are working

NOTE: Make sure <<enonic-setup#hmdb, Enonic and the Headless Movie Database app is running on localhost:8080>> before you continue

Start Next.js in  **dev mode** by running the following commands from within your next project folder:

    npm install
    npm run dev

If Next boots without errors, point your browser to http://localhost:3000 to see the glorious result.

[TIP]
====
Running Next in DEV mode normally works fine, should you experience strange issues - simply reboot it using `npm run dev`

For more details on booting Next, check out the link:https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/cli[Next.js CLI docs].
====


== Next URL handling

This integrations makes the URLs in Next.js 1-1 with their respective counterparts in the CMS. So, http://localhost:3000 is linked to the site which is located on `/hmdb` in Content Studio.

By visiting http://localhost:3000/movies/se7en the Next server will lookup, fetch and return content found on the path '/hmdb/movies/se7en' in the CMS. 

TODO (image showing both next and CS at the same time)
.Default render: movie content item se7en
image:render-default-godfather.png[title="Default render: movie content item The Godfather",width=512px]

.Se7en as seen in Content Studio edit mode
image:path-content-item.png[title="The Godfather content item in Content Studio edit mode",width=400px]

### Task: Visit some more pages

Give the default rendering a spin by trying out some other URLs, for example: +

* http://localhost:3000/movies +
* http://localhost:3000/persons +
* http://localhost:3000/persons/brad-pitt

...etc.


**That's it for the basic Next.js setup.**

In <<rendering-basics#, the next chapter>>, we'll get into how we can customize the rendering.
