In this chapter, we will build a custom app based on the HMDB project, and play around with the Headless API

== Enonic at a glance

Our platform is actually called Enonic XP (XP, or Enonic for short).

=== Enonic apps
Enonic XP allows you to install and run one or more link:https://developer.enonic.com/guides/developer-101/xp7/apps[**applications**] in a single instance.

You can discover ready to run applications on link:https://market.enonic.com/[Enonic Market], or you may build your own, like we will be doing in this tutorial.
Each app may provide specific functionality. It may for instance be everything you need for a large website, or provide only specific services, such as an **API**. An app is given an <<#new-project, **app name**>> when it's built.

Apps may provide a range of different functionality. For this tutorial we will focus on headless CMS capabilities.

TIP: Useful terminology: A **sandbox** is a local Enonic server running on your laptop. Apps are built from **projects** which are basically a folder that contains the app's source code. Once it is built, it can be **deployed** to the sandbox - where it will be started and made available.

For production use and CI/CD, Enonic apps may be installed in many different ways, typically using link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/enonic-cli/master[enonic CLI]. In some cases, apps may even be installed directly via the Enonic link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/admin#admin_console[Admin console].

=== Content

Apps typically ship with one or more link:https://developer.enonic.com/guides/developer-101/xp7/content[**content types**]. Content types typically define data structures (similar to fields in classes in object-oriented languages). Each content type gets a unique name which is automatically pre-fixed with the app-name. e.g. `<appName>:<contentTypeName>`.

Content types are used to create **content items**. Content is commonly created and handled via Enonic's link:https://enonic.com/blog/publishing-power-enonic-content-studio-cheat-sheet[**Content Studio**]. Content may be organised in tree structures, which can be useful both for internal purposes, but also externally - as we will see in this tutorial.

All content items get a unique path **name** when creating it - this is similar to a filename - and a human-friendly displayName.

Content can exist on two different link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/storage/branches[**branches**]: When creating or editing in Content Studio, you're always working on the `draft` branch. When publishing, new items and changes are copied to the `master` branch - which is often publicly accessible.

== The Headless Movie Database

With Enonic, you may obviously create your own content model, but to save time, we'll be using a demo-app known as the link:https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/headless-movie-db[Headless Movie Database] (HMDB) as our starting point.

HMDB ships with a pre-defined content-model and some useful sample content. It also exposes the content through a link:https://graphql.org/[graphQL] API. This API gives us access to the content.

Let's get going!

=== Task: Create application from template

. link:https://developer.enonic.com/start[**Install the Enonic CLI**] (follow link for instructions).

. **Create a new project** using the "Headless movie database" as your template:
+
Run the following command from your terminal
+
  enonic project create -r app-hmdb
+
NOTE: Stick with the standard values and keep the suggested project name `com.example.myproject` for the examples in the tutorial to work properly.
This will be referred to as **app name** later in this tutorial.
+
. **Deploy the application** by running this command from your freshly created project folder.
+
  enonic project deploy
+
The application will now be built. When asked to start a sandbox (a local instance of XP running its own content storage area), hit _Yes_. Enonic starts, outputs some server logs, and the sample content is imported.
+
. **Install and test Content Studio**.
+
Navigate to http://localhost:8080 and log in to the admin console (you don't have to create a user for this tutorial).
+
Install **Content Studio** (it's an XP app of its own) by completing the _XP Tour_ , or via the Applications admin app.
+
From the _XP_ menu, open `Content Studio`, and choose the `Headless demo` project if needed. You should see something like this:
+

+
NOTE: Some items have a default preview. That's okay for now - as we will customize this preview later.

**Congrats on setting up the Enonic development environment**

With the SDK running, lets have a look at <<api-primer#, the headless API>>.
