= Content Studio preview

In this chapter, we'll enable editors to preview the Next rendering directly from Content Studio.

## Task: Enable preview 

To get preview working, we need to make a few changes to the Enonic application:

Follow the steps below to get it working:

. **Add a proxy controller**, that can fetch rendered HTML and assets from the Next server
+
Rather than implementing this ourselves, we'll simply add the https://github.com/enonic/lib-nextjs-proxy[Nextjs proxy library] to the Enonic application we created earlier. 
+
The proxy is optimized for Next, as it performs some special handling and processing related to assets and the /_next path.
+
.Add the include line below to your project's build.gradle file
[source, groovy, options="nowrap"]
----
dependencies {
    ...
    include 'com.enonic.lib:lib-nextjs-proxy:<version>'
    ...
}
----
+
NOTE: <version> must be replaced by the current version. Visit the library on link:https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/nextjs-proxy-lib[Enonic Market]. Click `Get started` and choose the latest version.
+
. *Add a controller mapping*
+
In this step, we will activate Content Studio's preview to use the proxy
+
Update the `site.xml` , https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/components/mappings[mappings] section to look like this:
+
.src/main/resources/site/site.xml
[source, xml]
----
...
  <mappings>
    <mapping controller="/controllers/graphql.js" order="50">
      <pattern>/_grapqhql</pattern>
    </mapping>
    <mapping controller="/lib/nextjs-proxy/proxy.js" order="99">
      <pattern>/.*</pattern>
    </mapping>
  </mappings>
...
----
+
This effectively replaces the preview that shipped with the app, with the proxy. All requests excluding `/_graphql` (which contains the headless API) will now be be handled by the proxy instead - as you can see from the `/.*` pattern, which essentially means "catch all" URL patterns.
+
NOTE: If the headless API mappings come in conflicts with your Next.js app, you can always change the mapping above.
+
Redeploy the Enonic app after saving the changes:
+
    enonic project deploy
+
. *Verify the preview*
+
By default, the proxy is configured to access the Next.js server on localhost:3000, later we will look into how this can be changed - but essentially this means everything should be working instantly.
+
From Content Studio, select (or edit) any item in the content hierarchy, and it should be rendered by Next.js and visible in the preview panel on the right:

That completes the preview setup, moving forward, we'll make it possible to <<pages#, build pages editorially>>.
